This project is simple, just a technical assessment for Dart/Flutter;
this is a cross-platform application for iOS and Android, the application contains
simple views, one is a splash screen with the company's logo in the middle and upon
clicking the logo it redirects to another page where it fetches data from
**https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos** and display an infinite list of data,
then the last screen is fetching data from **https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos**
and display images in an infinite grid view.
